= Getting Started

== Introduction

This guide will help you prepare for building your CEM3340 VCO module. Before starting assembly, carefully review the prerequisites and component requirements below to ensure you have everything needed for a successful build.

== Prerequisites

=== Tools Required

* Soldering iron and solder
* Wire cutters or flush-cut snips
* Small flat-head screwdriver (for trimmer pot calibration)
* Multimeter (for testing and calibration)
* Oscilloscope or audio interface with oscilloscope software (e.g., free Zeitnitz Scope program) for VCO tuning

=== Components

==== Oscillator Chip

The original Kassutronics VCO3340 was built and tested using the AS3340 oscillator chip. This build uses the CEM3340, which works perfectly. Other variants (AS3340, V3340, etc.) should work without modifications.

==== Capacitors

*Timing Capacitor (C1):* Must be NP0 or C0G ceramic for temperature stability.

*Electrolytic Capacitors (C9, C10, C13):* Use low-profile versions (max height 11mm, lower is better) to ensure adequate clearance between stacked boards. Verify clearance with your chosen pin headers before soldering.

*Bypass Capacitors (10nF and 100nF):* Specified as X7R ceramic. NP0/C0G or film types are acceptable alternatives, but must have 2.5mm or 2.54mm pin spacing.

==== Resistors

All resistors are 1/4W metal film, 1% tolerance. 1/8W resistors can be substituted without issues.

*Matched Pair (R19 and R23):* For optimal V/Oct tracking, match these resistors to within 0.1kΩ of each other. Test multiple resistors and select the best-matched pair. The absolute value matters less than how closely they match each other.

==== Other Components

*Sync Switch:* Sub-miniature SPDT switch (available from suppliers like Thonk).

*Sine Shaping JFET:* MMBFJ201 in SOT-23 package.
